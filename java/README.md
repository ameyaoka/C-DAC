# java c-dac 

- simula , smalltalk was first oop based language .

- Ada first object-based programming language .

- architecture neutral .

- platform dependant . (requires os cannot install directly on hardware).

- portable ( can execute on any os ) .

- java is high level , statically type checked , objected-oriented as well as functional language .
- java in a case sensitive language .

- jcp : java community process (standardization of java language. 

- jls : java language specification request 

	-  
- jsr : java specification request .  
- jcp :  java community process .

- sdk:  developement tools  , doc  , suppoeing lib , execution env , 

- jdk : java developement kit : 

- jre : rt.jar + java virtual machine . ( java runtime environment ) 

- jvm : java virtual machine .




- .class file is generated for every class , interface .

- enum is a special data type 

- can java compile empty .java file .

- yes ( but .class file will not be generated ) .


- java packages contains 

1 errors 
2 annotation types
3 interfaces 
4 sub packages  
5. exception 
6. classes  
	- classes can contain : 

			- class  ( nested class) 
			- enum 
			- interface 


- what are modifiers :

- used to change behavior of classes , methodes , variable .
- unlike cpp in java defaut access modifier is default 

- 
	- access modifiers 
		- private 
		- public 
		- protected 
		- default ( no modifier) ( package-private modifier) 

	- non-access modifiers 

		- final 
		- static 
		- abstract 
		- synchronized 



## main method 

- Entry point for the execution of your compiled code .

- when you define a method 


- Fields 

- methods  

-  class names follows pascal casing . 

-

- methods :


method with no return type  and with no argunments .

- method with args  .

- method with return type and no args .
- with args and return type


- method def .

- syntax 

 modifier returnType methodName(Parameter List) {
    // Method body
}

-  
- method body :

## data types in java


- primitive data type 
- value type  
- store value directly 

- non-primitive data type 
- reference var 
- store address of value (points address)


- local variable must be initialized before it is used .


- float - 200.00f .

- Lossy conversion refers to a method of converting data between different storage formats where the resulting data is "close enough" to the original but may differ in some aspects


-   This type of casting automatically converts a smaller data type to a larger one without the risk of data loss. F

- narrowing casting involves manually converting a larger data type to a smaller one. This type of casting requires explicit instructions to avoid data loss.
