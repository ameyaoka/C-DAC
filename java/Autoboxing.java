// what are primitive data types 

/* most basic data types available .

-  they serve as building blocks for data manipulation .

- A Wrapper class in Java is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types

- there are 8 types  

1. boolean 
2. byte 
3. short 
4. int 
5. long 
6. float 
7. double 
8. char 

- what are non- primitive data types 

-  non-primitive data types are created by developers to handle more advanced data structures and operations.
 - class 
 - array 
 - interface 

 - difference between int primitive vs int object 

 - int is stored as 32-bit signed twos compliment 

 - int object is an obj warps in int value  

 - memory allocation for int is straight forward 
 - memory allocation for Int object requires additional memory overhead like object head reference count .

 - Autoboxing and unboxing are features introduced in Java to simplify the conversion between primitives and objects. Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of a primitive type to its corresponding wrapper class object, and unboxing is the reverse process.
